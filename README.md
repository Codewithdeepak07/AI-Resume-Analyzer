## <a name="tech-stack">⚙️ Tech Stack</a>  
- **[React](https://react.dev/)** is a popular open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces using reusable components and a virtual DOM, enabling efficient, dynamic single-page and native apps.  
- **[React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com/)** is the go-to routing library for React apps, offering nested routes, data loaders/actions, error boundaries, code splitting, and SSR support—all with a smooth upgrade path from v6.  
- **[Puter.com](https://jsm.dev/resumind-puter)** is an advanced, open-source internet operating system designed to be feature-rich, exceptionally fast, and highly extensible.  
- **[Puter.js](https://jsm.dev/resumind-puterjs)** is a tiny client-side SDK that adds serverless auth, storage, database, and AI (GPT, Claude, DALL·E, OCR…) straight into your browser app—no backend needed and costs borne by users.  
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to design custom user interfaces by applying low-level utility classes directly in HTML.  
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, providing better tooling, code quality, and error detection.  
- **[Vite](https://vite.dev/)** is a fast build tool and dev server using native ES modules for instant startup, HMR, and Rollup-powered production builds.  
- **[Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)** is a minimal, hook-based state management library for React.
